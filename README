---- Original README -----
Installation via Cabal.

There are two displays to choose from. One based on vty,
one based on gtk2hs. The gtk2hs variant is the default.
To get the other, pass -f-gtk to Setup configure.

This is the first public release of LambdaHack made by Andreas Loh on
April 9th, 2008.  It has been patched to get it to compile with GHC 7.8.3.
Also, the default client has been changed to the vty client.
Use the `-fgtk` flag to use the gtk client, although this has not been tried.

The file `cabal-deps` contains the specific package ids used to
successfully build this package.
